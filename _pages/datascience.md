## Tapping into the Field

I tapped into Statistics on my first intership at University of Vermont EPSCOR program, under the mentorship of Dr. Declan McCabe. Here was my first exposure to experimental design, hypothesis testing and ANOVA. My first research project focused on identifying the differences in abundances of macroinvertebrates (specifically scrappers) at different streams located in urban and rural areas.  Here I had to set sample collection sites within the stream, collect and taxonomically identify each bug and determine their respective abundances.  Anova was used to identify differences in the samples accounting for their location within the stream and rural/urban area. It was determined via these methods, that the population of macroinvertebrates in urban areas was minimized due to stream pollution affecting oxygen levels and therefore life viability within the stream. 

My second research was at the University of Iowa, Biostatistics Department where we collected sleep data on sleep apnea patients through an actigraphy watch to determine if CPAP machines aided in the improvement of sleep patterns. Time Series analysis was used to account for any variances in the longitudinal data. 

My third and fourth research were at the University of Alabama at their Statistical Genetics Department under the mentorship of Ana Vazquez.  This research focused on creating models to predict Type 2 Diabetes in patients accounting for their physical and genetic composition.  As a GWAS study, I analyzed data collected from a Affimetrix Chip to determine SNPs and markers being highlighted in Type 2 Diabetes patients and to see if these were also present in non-affected patients and how they played a role in increasing the odds of Type 2 diabetes GIVEN the patients exercise activity, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, gender and age.  Machine Learning Models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks were used to test models.  All of the results are published in my paper here: [linktopaper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4362394/).

After graduating from my masters in Data Science I served as a Data Analytics Teaching Assistant and Statistics Instructor at Trilogy Education now U2, helping a cohort of 25 students to kickstart their carreer into Data Analytics.  Here I taught SQL, Postgres, Tableu, Hypothesis Testing, Vizualization and Story Telling, VBA, Python and R. 

And the biggest experience of them all, was the learning I received during my Masters in Statistics.
