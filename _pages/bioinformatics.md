## THE JOURNEY

I tapped into Bioinformatics when I was hired at LNLL as an Computation Intern the Summer of 2015.  I worked in the Global Security - Bioinformatics Group under the mentorship of Jonathan Allen, PhD performing metagenomic analyses and updating their database composed of viral, bacterial, plant and other genomes retrieved from NCBI.  [link to LMAT website](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/livermore-metagenomics-analysis-toolkit). I expanded the toolkit by adding plots and statistical features. 

This opportunity allowed me to work in projects with the FDA, NASA and the Department of Health of Oasaka Japan.  I also co-authored in some of their papers on this matter.  I am forever grateful to the Team that supported me and introduced me to the field of bioinformatics and showed me how I could apply my statistics and mathematics background in this field.  Within the 4 years at LLNL, I went from a Computation Intern to become a Data Scientist for the team.

In 2019 I was hired as a Bioinformatics Scientist at Tecan, where I tapped into the ins and outs of product development and served as the lead bioinformatician for several products.  I also worked very closely with the Quality Control and Manufacturing Team, analyzing samples from their batches to make sure they complied with the product specifications for performance and also aided in creating such metrics for the QC of the products I was helping develop.  This experience made me be avid in detecting possible problems that could affect the quality of the product early on in the lifecycle. 

After a year in this role and I started leading the bioinformatics team, and managing a team of DevOps in the automation of the internal pipelines as well as the front-end design and features.  I also managed one employee and was the first point of contact for managing and reporting to customer requests, with the help of the Customer Service Department. 

In 2022, I was hired at EclipseBioInnovations as a Bioinformatics Scientists to serve as the statistics expert matter.  With the direction of the Bioinformatics Director Stephanie Burns, I developed a product with emphasis on creating mRNA secondary structure databases derived from tissues.  This toolkit was also used and expanded to predict the secondary structure of LNP encapsulated RNA's and manufactured RNAs, for the use of vaccine development and other gene therapeutics.  Within this role, I wore many hats and achieved the following things:

- Worked for customer projects that needed statistical validations developing the proper analysis given the experimental settings and objectives.

- Served as the project lead in a team with 2 bioinformatic engineers automating internal pipelines.  Here I prototyped, accounted for different case scenarios, developed interactive reports and searched for ways to optimize running time and turnaround time. 

- Collaborated with the Marketing Department with analysis of Marketing Data, in order to optimize the Google Ads and campaigns being run and therefore decrease expenses.  My analysis forecasted a 20% decreased in monthly budget by analyzing keywords and other engagement metrics extracted from Google Analytics. 

- Led the creation of a Quality Control Team, filling the need to properly QC kits in order to enhance customer satisfaction and state the boundaries and conditions in which the products performs best. Developed a QC pipeline with the help of 2 bioinformatics scientists and created SOPs to document all the above processes. 


## BIOINFORMATICS CODE/WORK

Customer facing script developed to extract reactivity values for a specific region of interest as stated in a bed file, and produce the necessary input files to produce the secondary structure in open-sourced folding algorithms.
